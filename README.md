# Black-Scholes-Project
This project is a combination of finance theory and Python implementation, designed to help me understand how options are valued and how quantitative models connect to trading decisions.
The project has two main parts:

1. Theory Notes – A structured writeup covering the basics of options, the motivation behind pricing models, the Black–Scholes formula, its assumptions, and how traders use it in practice.

2. Python Implementation – A Jupyter notebook and script that:
- Implements the Black–Scholes formula for European call and put options
- Allows user input for stock price, strike, time to maturity, volatility, and interest rates
- Output theoretical option prices for different scenarios
